            Hey there, I just wanted to say... I'm really sorry. I know I messed up big time. First of all, I'm sorry for being late with your gift. I had it all planned out, but life got in the way, and I ended up being late. I feel terrible about that.

And you know what? I'm also sorry for being rude and throwing my traumas at you. It wasn't fair, and it wasn't right. You deserve so much better than that, and I should have been more understanding and supportive.

I just want you to know that I really do appreciate your gift. It means a lot to me, and I love that you put so much thought into it. You always know how to make me smile, even when I'm feeling down.

I promise to work on myself and be better. I want us to be happy together, and I don't want to let my past affect our future.

So, here's my apology, straight from my heart. I hope you can forgive me and give us a chance to move forward together.

Love you lots, and I'm sorry again for everything.
          </p>
