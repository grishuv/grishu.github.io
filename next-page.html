      <b><p style="color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.473)">I need to talk to you about something that's been on my mind for a while now. I wanted to say sorry for not being around much in the past couple of months. It's just that I was working hard on creating a website gift for you, and it took up so much of my time and focus.

        I didn't mean to ignore you or make you feel neglected. I was genuinely excited about surprising you with the gift, but I guess I got carried away and didn't realize how much it was affecting us. Looking back, I see how I messed up, and I feel awful about it.
        
        You're so important to me, and I never want to hurt you. I know my actions haven't shown that lately, and I regret not giving our relationship the attention it deserves. I promise I'll do better moving forward.
        
        I've learned from this experience, and I want to make things right between us. I don't expect you to forget or forgive right away, but I hope you can find it in your heart to give me another chance. I love you, and I want to show you how much you mean to me.
        
        Can we talk about this in person? I want to hear your feelings and work together to make our relationship stronger. Just know that I'm truly sorry, and I'll do whatever it takes to make things better.
        
        Love you, and i hope uh will like my this gift for you  </p></b>
